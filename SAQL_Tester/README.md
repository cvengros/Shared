Example input:

Tips:
- The above example will not work for your org. It is provided for syntax help only.
- It is recommended that you use browser developer tools (F12) to get a query to start with. Look in the response to the "remote" POST.
- You may escape double-quotes, but it is not necessary here. However, you must escape double-quotes when you use this in the "pigql" tag of your dashboard JSON.
- You may use newlines here. However, you can not use newlines in the "pigql" tag of your dashboard JSON.
- Dataset names will not work here. You must use the fully-qualified "id/version" identifier.
